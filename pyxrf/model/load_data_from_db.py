    Load data from database and save it in HDF5 files.

    Parameters
    ----------

    start : int
        Run ID (positive or negative int) or  of the first scan to convert or Run UID
        (str, full or short). If `start` is UID, then `end` must not be provided or set to None.
    end : int, optional
        scan ID of the last scan to convert. If ``end`` is not specified or None, then
        only the scan with ID ``start`` is converted and an exception is raised if an
        error occurs during the conversion. If ``end`` is specified, then scans in the
        range ``scan``..``end`` are converted and a scan in the sequence is skipped
        if there is an issue during the conversion. For example:

        .. code-block:: python

            make_hdf(2342)

        will process scan #2342 and throw an exception if error occurs. On the other hand

        .. code-block:: python

            make_hdf(2342, 2342)

        will process scan #2342 and write data to file if conversion is successful, otherwise
        no file will be created. The scans with IDs in the range 2342..2441 can be processed by
        calling

        .. code-block:: python

            make_hdf(2342, 2441)

        Scans with IDs in specified range, but not existing in the database, or scans causing errors
        during conversion will be skipped.

    fname : string, optional keyword parameter
        path to save data file when ``end`` is ``None`` (only one scan is processed).
        File name is created automatically if ``fname`` is not specified.
    wd : str
        working directory, the file(s) will be created in this directory. The directory
        will be created if it does not exist. If ``wd`` is not specified, then the file(s)
        will be saved to the current directory.
    fname_add_version : bool, keyword parameter
        True: if file already exists, then file version is added to the file name
        so that it becomes unique in the current directory. The version is
        added to <fname>.h5 in the form <fname>_(1).h5, <fname>_(2).h5, etc.
        False: then conversion fails. If ``end`` is ``None``, then
        the exception is raised. If ``end`` is specified, the scan is skipped
        and the next scan in the range is processed.
    completed_scans_only : bool, keyword parameter
        True: process only completed scans (for which ``stop`` document exists in
        the database). Failed scan for which ``stop`` document exists are considered
        completed even if not the whole image was scanned. If incomplete scan is
        encountered: an exception is thrown (``end`` is not specified) or the scan

        supports the existing workflows.
        False: the feature is disabled, incomplete scan will be processed.
    successful_scans_only : bool, keyword parameter
        Similar to ``complete_scans_only``. The file is created only if the stop document
        exists and ``exit_status=='success'``.
    file_overwrite_existing : bool, keyword parameter
        This option should be used if the existing file should be deleted and replaced
        with the new file with the same name. This option should be used with caution,
        since the existing file may contain processed data, which will be permanently deleted.
        True: overwrite existing files if needed. Note, that if ``fname_add_version`` is ``True``,
        then new versions of the existing file will always be created.
        False: do not overwrite existing files. If the file already exists, then the exception
        will be raised (loading the single scan) or the scan will be skipped (loading the range
        of scans).
    prefix : str, optional
        prefix name of the created data file. If ``fname`` is not specified, it is generated
        automatically in the form ``<prefix>_<scanID>_<some_additional_data>.h5``
    create_each_det: bool, optional
        True: save data for each available detector channel into a file. Enabling this
        feature leads to larger data files. Inspection of data from individual channels
        of the detector may be helpful in evaluation of quality of the detector calibration
        and adds flexibility to data analysis. This feature may be disabled if large number
        of routine scans recorded by well tested system are processed and disk space
        is an issue.
        False: disable the feature. Only the sum of all detector channels is saved
        to disk.
    save_scaler : bool, optional
        True: save scaler data in the data file
        False: do not save scaler data
    num_end_lines_excluded : int, optional
        The number of lines at the end of the scan that will not be saved to the data file.

    Transfer the data from databroker into a correct format following the
    shape of 2D scan.
    This function is used at SRX beamline for both fly scan and step scan.
    Save to hdf file if needed.

    .. note:: Requires the databroker package from NSLS2

    Parameters
    ----------
    run_id_uid : int
        ID or UID of a run
    fpath: str
        path to save hdf file
    create_each_det: bool, optional
        Do not create data for each detector is data size is too large,
        if set as false. This will slow down the speed of creating hdf file
        with large data size.
    fname_add_version : bool
        True: if file already exists, then file version is added to the file name
        so that it becomes unique in the current directory. The version is
        added to <fname>.h5 in the form <fname>_(1).h5, <fname>_(2).h5, etc.
        False: then conversion fails.
    completed_scans_only : bool
        True: process only completed scans (for which ``stop`` document exists in
        the database). Failed scan for which ``stop`` document exists are considered
        completed even if not the whole image was scanned. If incomplete scan is
        encountered: an exception is thrown.
        False: the feature is disabled, incomplete scan will be processed.
    file_overwrite_existing : bool, keyword parameter
        This option should be used if the existing file should be deleted and replaced
        with the new file with the same name. This option should be used with caution,
        since the existing file may contain processed data, which will be permanently deleted.
        True: overwrite existing files if needed. Note, that if ``fname_add_version`` is ``True``,
        then new versions of the existing file will always be created.
        False: do not overwrite existing files. If the file already exists, then the exception
        is raised.
    output_to_file : bool, optional
        save data to hdf5 file if True
    save_scaler : bool, optional
        choose to save scaler data or not for srx beamline, test purpose only.
    num_end_lines_excluded : int, optional
        remove the last few bad lines

    Returns

      It is recommended to read data from databroker into memory
    directly, instead of saving to files. This is ongoing work.

    Parameters
    ----------
    run_id_uid : int
        ID or UID of a run
    fpath: str
        path to save hdf file
    create_each_det: bool, optional
        Do not create data for each detector if data size is too large,
        if set as False. This will slow down the speed of creating an hdf5 file
        with large data size.
    fname_add_version : bool
        True: if file already exists, then file version is added to the file name
        so that it becomes unique in the current directory. The version is
        added to <fname>.h5 in the form <fname>_(1).h5, <fname>_(2).h5, etc.
        False: then conversion fails.
    completed_scans_only : bool
        True: process only completed scans (for which ``stop`` document exists in
        the database). Failed scan for which ``stop`` document exists are considered
        completed even if not the whole image was scanned. If incomplete scan is
        encountered: an exception is thrown.
        False: the feature is disabled, incomplete scan will be processed.
    file_overwrite_existing : bool, keyword parameter
        This option should be used if the existing file should be deleted and replaced
        with the new file with the same name. This option should be used with caution,
        since the existing file may contain processed data, which will be permanently deleted.
        True: overwrite existing files if needed. Note, that if ``fname_add_version`` is ``True``,
        then new versions of the existing file will always be created.
        False: do not overwrite existing files. If the file already exists, then the exception
        is raised.
    output_to_file : bool, optional
        save data to hdf5 file if True

    represented as a dictionary with the following keys:

      keys 'det1', 'det2' etc. - 3D ndarrays of size (N, M, K) where NxM are dimensions of the map
      and K is the number of spectrum points (4096) contain data from the detector channels 1, 2, 3 etc.

      key 'det_sum' - 3D ndarray with the same dimensions as 'det1' contains the sum of the channels

      key 'scaler_names' - the list of scaler names

      key 'scaler_data' - 3D ndarray of scaler values. The array shape is (N, M, P), where P is
      the number of scaler names.

      key 'pos_names' - the list of position (axis) names, must contain the names 'x_pos' and 'y_pos'
      in correct order.

      key 'pos_data' - 3D ndarray with position values. The array must have size (2, N, M). The first
          index is the number of the position name 'pos_names' list.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fpath: str
        Full path to the HDF5 file. The function creates an new HDF5 file. If file already exists
        and ``file_overwrite_existing=False``, then the IOError exception is raised.
    data : dict
        The dictionary of raw data.
    metadata : dict
        Metadata to be saved in the HDF5 file. The function will add or overwrite the existing
        metadata fields: ``file_type``, ``file_format``, ``file_format_version``, ``file_created_time``.
        User may define metadata fields ``file_software`` and ``file_software_version``. If ``file_software``
        is not defined, then the default values for ``file_software`` and ``file_software_version`` are added.
    fname_add_version : boolean
        True: if file already exists, then file version is added to the file name
        so that it becomes unique in the current directory. The version is
        added to <fname>.h5 in the form <fname>_v1.h5, <fname>_v2.h5, etc.
        False: the exception is raised if the file exists.
    file_overwrite_existing : boolean
        Overwrite the existing file or raise exception if the file exists.
    create_each_det : boolean
        Save data from individual detectors (``True``) or only the sum of fluorescence from
        all detectors (``False``).

    Raises
    ------
    IOError
        Failed to write data to HDF5 file.
